This folder contains the output of diffs* between rows of new "dates fixed" vs. old isatab/a_collection.txt for each continent. These are generated by test.sh, which also generates a log.txt which will have errors recorded if there are any.

* Instead of using the standard diff command, I used the oldiff.py which applies an "orderless diff". This looks for comparisons between the lines of two files without caring which order tehse lines are in. Example of it's usage: 

python /home/ab108/software/oldiff.py --file1 /home/ab108/popbio/data_andy/isatabs/andy_0411_MAP/old/Europe/a_collection.txt --file2 /home/ab108/0VB/isatab/malariaAtlas/data/isatab/Europe/a_collection.txt
